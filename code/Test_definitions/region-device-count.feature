Feature: CAMARA Region Device Count API v0.2.0-rc.1 - Operations for device count in specified area

# Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
#
# Implementation indications:
# * Min start and end dates allowed
# * Max requested time period allowed
# * Max size of the response(Combination of area, starttime, endtime requested) supported for a sync response
# * Max size of the response(Combination of area, starttime, endtime requested) supported for an async response
# * Limitations about max complexity of requested area allowed
# * API support filtering functionality or not and the supported filter types.
#
# Testing assets:
# * An Area within the supported region
# * An Area partially within the supported region
# * An Area outside the supported region
# * A combination of request parameters including area, start time, and end time, such that the number of connected devices in the area is below the local regulatory privacy threshold
